The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema containing a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, budget, revenue, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more.

Scope & Purpose:
Analyze the data available on IMDB for movies released between 2000 and 2019.

Questions that our analysis will answer:
Which genres have the most movies?
Which genres have high production budgets?
Which genres are more profitable?
